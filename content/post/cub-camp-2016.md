Just back from a great week camping at [Butchers Coppice](http://butcherscoppice.org.uk/) with the
[1st Nork Cubs](http://www.1stnorkscoutgroup.org/cubs.htm)! We had 28 Cubs and 7 Scouts/young leaders.

We had a busy week, with activities such as axe throwing, bouldering, a visit to the
[Bovington Tank Museum](http://www.tankmuseum.org/home) and a great day put to 
[Brownsea Island](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/brownsea-island) famous within scouting for being the location of
the [first scout camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsea_Island_Scout_camp) as organised by the founder of
scouting [Lieutenant-General Baden-Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baden-Powell,_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell).
