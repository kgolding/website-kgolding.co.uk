It's here at last! For the last 12 months, that is all of 2019, I have used Linux on the desktop as my primary desktop operating system!

I have used Windows, but only very rarely to run a very small number of Windows only applications such as niche two-way radio programming applications and annoyingly my Brother QL label printer.

My Linux distribution of choice is **[Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/)**, which is built on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and thus very well supported, but with the beautiful, easy to use and powerful KDE Plasma desktop.

Moving from Windows has been quite painless, and I very quickly realised just how nice Kubuntu is to use, and now I couldn't live without some of the fantastic features Linux offers over and above Windows.

### Favourite features
* **KDE Connect** enables sharing the clipboard, notifications and files between laptop, desktop and mobile phone. Hitting Ctrl-C (copy) on some text on the laptop and pasting it on the mobile phone just doesn't get old!
* **LibreOffice** is MS Office before the horrible ribbon toolbar came along. It opens everything I've ever needed too, and the Impress application beats MS Powerpoint in so many ways! And using KDE Connect as a wireless touchpad unties you from the laptop when presenting.
* **Speed!** Kubuntu is fast. Applications open instantly and I can't remember what a "Window is not responding" message looks like anymore!
* **Battery life** is excellent on my Lenovo laptop. It's three years old, and before it was upgraded from Windows to Linux battery life was around 3 hours. Now I get from 5 to 7 hours!
* **Development tools** are so well supported on Linux. I can write and compile web applications, cross-compile apps to ARM, MIPS, x86 with ease and I can even compile Windows & MAC OS apps!
* **Compatibility** with third-party services is awesome. I use well-known favourites such as Dropbox, Evernote, Google drive/email/photos, Skype, Zoom, Teamviewer, AnyDesk without any issues! Ironically Skype works faultlessly, something that I couldn't say when I had it on Windows 7!
