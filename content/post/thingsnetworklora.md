LoRa is a modern Internet of Things (IoT) focused protocol for sending small amounts of data
over great distances using low power. Transmitters run up to 100mW but can reach distances of 16km!

[The things network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) is a cloud service that is creating a public worldwide
network of gateways. The gateways are provided freely by the community, and each gateway can be freely used on the
network both for receiving and transmission. My gateway can be seen at https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/u/kgolding

**Update Feb 2020**

Having finally got around to putting up an external antenna I'm starting to see third party traffic through my TTN gateway!
