### What users say:
> Just to let you know I was in a very important meeting yesterday (the Official Secrets Act forbids me from saying
> any more :-)) and thanks to PsiMind I was able to translate all our whiteboard scribblings into an electronic
> document and distribute it among the attendees within half an hour of the meeting ending. _Harry Payne_

> I would like to say THANK YOU for your great program "psiMind"! The app runs perfectly on my 5 mx pro and allows me
> a fast and smooth handling of my thoughts and plans. Superb! :-) _Andreas Thaler_

> Thanks for the great app, psiMind I mean! I'm a quite experienced Psion Revo user and somewhat software engineering
> enthusiast, and I must say PsiMind's feature set is very elegant! It does just what is needed, no more. I like that
> a lot, psiMind has got into my RevoPlus to stay.
> It'll even stay if I ever need to fall back to my Revo 8MB! _Hannu Luomanen_

> Kevin, a brief line to say thanks for the freeware. I read a review in Palmtop magazine and wanted to try it.
> The file was so small (download so fast) that I actually thought there was a mistake and this wasn't
> fully-functioning freeware! _Jules P Attard_

> I'm a real novice and this is the first thing I have ever downloaded and installed. It went fine and I got the hang
> of it within minutes. I have now set up a map of my own for a forthcoming trek in Iceland.
> I've never even used mindmaps before having always been a lists person but with the ease of this I think
> I'll be converted. _Angela Alexander_

> It's very intuitive... nice one! _Neil Martin_

> This is a very nice bit of software - I've been using it to plan a forthcoming holiday and I'll show it off at work
> - they mostly have Palms there. Heh, Heh. _Christopher Lawley_

> I've been playing around a bit more with the software on my RevoPlus, and I must say it has the capability to
> completely revolutionise the way I use my Revo. _Alan Simkins_
