I co-founded [Wirefree IP Ltd](http://wirefreeip.com) which is a trade only provider of IP wireless links mainly within the electronic security
industry. The company provides a turn-key solution at fixed prices for security installers.

Our links are custom made, using a combination of third party antennas and wireless transceiver's. Each link is
installed, commissioned, tested and presented to the security installer as a 'virtual ethernet cable' taking away
the complexities of encryption, IP routing etc.
