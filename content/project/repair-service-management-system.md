POS Ltd was the only third party service provider for the [PSION](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_(company))
range of PDA's (active in the late nineties and noughties).
The company provided a repair service to end users and to the trade alike.

As the company expanded in line with the massive success of PSION, the various spreadsheets that were used to track
repairs became unwieldily and were slowing down the repair process.

I was commissioned to create a service management system to handle the entire process from booking in, repair,
and booking out.

I built an Intranet system using PHP & MySQL, and the system was used successfully for the next decade with very little
maintenance. The system allowed admin staff to book in repairs that were displayed to the engineers for repair.
Engineers could record serial numbers, parts used etc and once repaired admin staff arranged the return of the
PDA's to the customer.
