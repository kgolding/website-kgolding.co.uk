There's a busy shopping centre in the heart of Manchester, and for the safety and security of their staff and the
general public they wanted to require all the audio conversations over the MOTOTRBO radio system.

Making use of my SMC Gateway product, the radio dealer was able to provide a quick to deplay and simple to use system
at an entry level cost.

The SMC Gateway is connected to a dedicated fixed mobile MOTOTRO radio and it records the time/date, radio identity and
the spoken text 24/7. The gateway does not require any other hardware like a PC or server, and the audio recordings
are access on demand via a password protected web portal over the internal LAN.
